### 11. What is the difference between WHERE and HAVING?
- `WHERE` filters **rows** before grouping
- `HAVING` filters **groups** after `GROUP BY`

### 12. What is a JOIN?
A JOIN is used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column.

### 13. What is INNER JOIN?

### 14. What is LEFT JOIN?
Returns all rows from the left table, and matched rows from the right table.

### 15. What is a constraint in MySQL?
A rule applied to a column (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE).

### 16. What is a UNIQUE constraint?
Ensures all values in a column are different.

### 17. What is a FOREIGN KEY?
A key that links one table to another.

### 18. How to insert data into a table?
```sql
INSERT INTO students (id, name) VALUES (1, 'Anurag');
```

### 19. How to update a record in a table?

## ðŸ”¹ Tricky / Conceptual Questions (26â€“50)

### 26. Difference between DELETE, TRUNCATE, and DROP?
| Command  | Description | Rollback Possible | Resets Auto-increment |
|----------|-------------|--------------------|-----------------------|
| DELETE   | Removes rows | Yes                | No                    |
| TRUNCATE | Removes all  | No                 | Yes                   |
| DROP     | Deletes table| No                 | -                     |

### 27. What is normalization?
Organizing data to reduce redundancy (repeated data).

### 28. What is denormalization?
Opposite of normalization â€” used to improve performance by allowing some redundancy.

### 29. What is a subquery?
A query inside another query.

### 30. What is a stored procedure?
A saved group of SQL statements that can be reused.

### 31. What is a trigger?
Code that runs automatically when something happens in the table (like insert, delete, update).

### 32. What is a transaction?
A group of SQL statements that are executed together. Either all succeed or all fail.

### 33. What are ACID properties?
- **A**tomicity
- **C**onsistency  
- **I**solation
- **D**urability  
These make transactions reliable.

### 34. What is the use of LIMIT in MySQL?
Restricts the number of rows returned.
```sql
SELECT * FROM students LIMIT 5;
```

### 35. What is the BETWEEN operator?
Used to filter a range:
```sql
SELECT * FROM students WHERE id BETWEEN 5 AND 10;
```

### 36. How to count records in a table?
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM students;
```

### 37. How to rename a column in MySQL?
```sql
ALTER TABLE students CHANGE name full_name VARCHAR(50);
```

### 38. What is the difference between CHAR and VARCHAR?
- `CHAR`: fixed length
- `VARCHAR`: variable length

### 39. How to check the MySQL version?

### 40. What are aggregate functions?
Functions that do a calculation on a set of values: `SUM()`, `AVG()`, `COUNT()`, `MAX()`, `MIN()`.

### 41. What is the default storage engine in MySQL?
InnoDB (supports transactions and foreign keys).

### 42. How to add a new column?
```sql
ALTER TABLE students ADD age INT;
```

### 43. How to remove a column?
```sql
ALTER TABLE students DROP COLUMN age;
```

### 44. What is the use of IFNULL()?
Returns a value if the column is `NULL`.

```sql
SELECT MAX(salary) FROM employees;
```

### 46. How to sort data?
```sql
SELECT * FROM students ORDER BY name ASC;
```

### 47. What is the difference between IS NULL and = NULL?
Use `IS NULL`, not `= NULL`.

### 48. What is a composite key?
A primary key using more than one column.

### 49. Can we have two primary keys in a table?
No, only one primary key per table, but it can be composite (multiple columns).

### 50. What is a schema in MySQL?
A schema is like a database â€” it holds tables, views, etc.
