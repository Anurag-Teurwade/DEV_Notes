**5. What is Docker Hub?**  
It is a cloud-based registry where Docker images are stored and shared.

**6. How do you check the Docker version?**  
`docker --version`

**7. How do you list running containers?**  
`docker ps`

**8. How do you list all containers (including stopped)?**  
`docker ps -a`

**9. What is the command to run a container?**  
`docker run <image>`

**10. How do you stop a running container?**  
`docker stop <container_id>`

### üü° Images & Dockerfile

**11. How do you pull an image from Docker Hub?**  
`docker pull <image>`

**12. How do you remove an image?**  
`docker rmi <image>`

**13. How do you build an image using a Dockerfile?**  
`docker build -t <image_name> .`

**14. What is a Dockerfile?**  
A text file with instructions to build a Docker image.

**15. What does the `FROM` instruction do?**
